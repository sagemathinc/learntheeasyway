Learn the Easy Way (LTEW) is an open source web app provided by SageMath Inc. The purpose of LTEW is to teach students who are unable to get themselves through other online courses like those provided by CodeCademy and Udacity. LTEW's methodology is one that focuses on teaching students programming syntax in very little chunks that are easy to follow with no gaps in information. Students pass say ten quizzes "Is this `_________` valid" before going on to the next piece of instruction. Initally LTEW will be very verbose and over time it will only be as verbose as it needs to be on a per student basis.
